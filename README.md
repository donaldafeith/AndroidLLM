# AndroidLLM

AndroidLLM will be an open-source chatbot application for Android that aims to democratize the creation and usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile devices and laptops. This project will serve as a practical demonstration of how to build, train, and deploy compact LLMs that can be efficiently run on resource-constrained devices.

## Features

- Free and open-source: AndroidLLM is available to everyone at no cost and with full access to the source code.
- On-device LLM: The chatbot runs locally on Android devices, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.
- Compact model size: The LLMs used in AndroidLLM are designed to be small enough to run on smartphones and laptops without compromising performance.
- Educational resources: The project provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials to guide users through the process of creating and training their own LLMs.

## Getting Started

To get started with AndroidLLM, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/donaldafeith/AndroidLLM.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies as will be outlined in the documentation.
3. Build and run the Android app on your device or emulator.
4. Explore the provided examples and tutorials to understand the process of creating and training LLMs.
5. Customize and train your own LLM based on your specific requirements.

## Documentation

I am currently working on the documentation which will cover various topics, including:

- Setting up the development environment
- Understanding the architecture of AndroidLLM
- Creating and preprocessing training data
- Training and fine-tuning LLMs
- Deploying LLMs on Android devices
- Best practices and optimization techniques
